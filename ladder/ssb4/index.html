            <h1>Tournament Rules</h1>
            <p>
                The Shen Ladder Tournament ranks players based on matches over the course of the semester. In contrast to a traditional tournament,
                a ladder tournament allows players to choose who they're going to challenge. The more skilled the player, the more your rank will rise.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tournament is Elo-based, but additional systems have been made to ensure players climb the ranks relatively easily.
            </p>
            <p>
                This tournament will run from <strong>Feburary 8, 2017</strong> to <strong>May 17, 2017</strong>.
                All ladder matches will take place in the Student Lounge at Leeward Community College every week on Wednesday and Thursday
                between the times of <strong>10:00 - 12:00 PM</strong> and <strong>2:00 - 4:00 PM</strong>.
            </p>
			<h2>How to Register</h2>
			<p>
                The entrance fee for the Ladder is <strong>$5.00</strong> and is one-time for the entire semester.
                There will also be three division-based traditional tournaments, which will have separate entrance fees.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, all registrants for this tournament need to meet the following requirements:
                <ul>
                    <li>Be a registered University of Hawaii student</li>
                    <li>Be a registered member of Club Shenanigans</li>
                </ul>
                Having an account on the Club Shenanigans Discord server is also highly recommended if you want the latest updates on your current statistics and rank.
			</p>
			<h2>How it Works</h2>
			<p>
                In a Ladder Tournament, your rank is based off your <strong>skill rating</strong>, which is a number that represents your skill.
            </p>
            <p>
                The ranks for all players will be updated and posted as much as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your goal during this tournament is to raise your skill level as much as possible by challenging players and winning matches.
                The rate of which your skill level rises depends on how strong the player you challenge is.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, if you finished three (3) matches, you will be assigned a division at the beginning of the next week.
                This division will represent your skill group among all the other players.
                There are four divisions: <strong>C, B, A, and S</strong>.
            <p>
            <h2>Prizes</h2>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Players who have been promoted to a higher division at the beginning of the week will be given a <strong>Division Card</strong>, a physical card that represents their division.</li>
                    <li>Players who show improvement in the form of a rising skill rating will have special recognition on our website and will be given a hand-drawn character icon to use online and on our website.</li>
                </ul>
                Other prizes are to be announced.
            </p>
			<h2>Challenging Players &amp; Scheduling Matches</h2>
            <p>
                On each ladder match day (Wednesday and Thursday), every match will be organized in 12 time-slots, 6 being between 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM and
                the other 6 being between 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM. A physical form will be avaliable on these days in which you can schedule your match. The same form will be used to report the results of the match as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qtssmz-o-aGGuqzXgT5BZPej32_F1B-oKdfrrb8318I/edit?usp=sharing">An example of what the schedule form looks like</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The general rule is that <strong>you can challenge any player as long as they registered in the tournament</strong>, but there are a few restrictions:
                <ol>
                    <li>Players may not challenge other players in a division below their own. <strong>If you have no division, this rule does not apply.</strong> Players who are in a division are allowed to challenge those who aren't.</li>
                    <li>Players may not challenge the same player multiple times in one day.</li>
                    <li>Players who already have a match scheduled may not challenge any other players until that match is over.</li>
                    <li>Players may only challenge up to three (3) times per day. This does not apply to other players challenging you.</li>
                    <li>Byes (missing scheduled matches) will count as a <strong>win by default</strong> for the player that is present. If both players are missing, it will be treated as a loss for both players' records.</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h2>In-game Rules</h2>
            <p>
                Each ladder match should follow traditional tournament match rules. Ladder matches are played in a best of <strong>3 rounds</strong>. If the match involves two players in <strong>Division S</strong>,
                then it will be played in a best of <strong>5 rounds</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Game Rules:
                <ul>
                    <li>Stock Battle (2 stocks)</li>
                    <li>No Items</li>
                    <li>6:00 Minute Timer</li>
                </ul>

                Legal Stages:
                <ul>
                    <li>Final Destination</li>
                    <li>Battlefield</li>
                    <li>Smashville</li>
                    <li>Town and City</li>
                </ul>

                During the first round, only starter stages can be chosen. The <strong>Defending Player</strong> (the player who was challenged) picks the first stage, and
                the loser of that round can then pick the stage for the next round, and so on.
            <p>
            <h2>Divisional Tournaments</h2>
            <p>
                As a compliment to the ladder tournament, Divisional Tournaments will also be hosted throughout the semester. These tournaments will be run like a traditional elimination tournament,
                except it will be split into high and low brackets based on your division as to give players of all skill levels a chance at winning. NOTE: Players with <strong>no division</strong> won't be able to enter.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, all matches that take place during a Divisional Tournament will double as ladder matches in the Ladder Tournament with a boost in rating change.
