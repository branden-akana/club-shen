### Bi Weekly Tournament and Big monthly tournaments

Rules:
- Legal stages only
- Bo3 (until finals Bo5)
- Single Elimination


This tournament will be run on a bi-weekly bases. Meaning it will be held every two weeks and will run for that whole two weeks. For example, if we open it on September 1, It will end on September 15. Players are given a total of two weeks to finish the tournament and there will check points for when each round ends and when a new rounds begins within the tournament. An example would be, if it opened on September 1, Round 1 would have to end September 5, and Round 2 begins afterwards until we finish the tournament. Players who do not do their rounds, or if an opponent is a no show get an automatic DQ.

The top 10 players of that tournament receive points. 1st gets 10 points and 10th gets 1 point. These points are used to determine power rankings. Placing in the big monthly tournaments will also net you points that will be used for the school power rankings.

The bi weekly tournament will be determined with a winner takes all based on half of the total entrance fee

Entrance fee is $10
- 5 will go to the biweekly prize pool
- 5 will go to the pot for the Big monthly tournament


The Big monthly tournament will have:
-Free food for entrants
-Entrance fee: 10
-Prizes: TBD + half of the total entrance fee collected for two biweekly tournaments.

### ELO System
Using Brandonâ€™s elo system we will allow players to continually hone their skills. Everyone will start at the same elo and progress from there. Every 100 elo points will be given an equivalent amount of Club Shen points. These Club Shen points can be used to redeem prizes, such as free entrance fee to the big tournament.
